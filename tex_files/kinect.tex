\chapter{Kinect}

In this chapter we will learn how to use the Kinect and create script to gather the data they collect in real time.

\section{Connecting to the Kinects}

Every Kinect has its own computer so you should first turn on all the computers you will need. After that you will have to connect the kinect to the main computer (the one you use to control motoman). All the computers are linked by ethernet cable so you can easily ssh into all of them. We have created a special function to connect automaticaly by ssh to an other computer, you just need to type \emph{ch1}, \emph{ch2} or \emph{ch3} in a terminal.
