\chapter{Introduction}
The motoman industrial robot is a complicated system that needs to be handled carefully. This manual was written to help to understand how to do basic operations such as connecting the robot to its rviz visualization, using motion planners and using the kinects.

The motoman robot is a very expensive system, if you are scared to do something wrong that could break it then please ask the more experienced lab members.

This is the original manual. A japanese version of this manual will be soon written but it will be less detailed. If you have any questions please check the english version (this one).
